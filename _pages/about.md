## Bio

Currently, I am a **Research Fellow** at the [Bangladesh Institute of Social Research (BISR) Trust](https://bisrbd.org/index.html). Prior to this role, I served as a **Research Associate** at the same institution, following my early research experience as a **Research Assistant** at [Change Initiative](https://www.changei.earth/).

I earned both my Bachelor’s **(BSS)** and Master’s **(MSS)** degrees in **Economics** from [Comilla University](https://www.cou.ac.bd/), where I also worked as a **Graduate Research Assistant** under the supervision of Dr. Kazi Mohammed Kamal Uddin during and shortly after my postgraduate studies.

## Other Engagements

#### Annual Conference on Social Research

For three consecutive years (2023, 2024, and 2025), I have been part of the organizing team of the Annual Conference on Social Research hosted by BISR Trust, the largest academic networking platform for social science researchers in Bangladesh. This year marks its tenth edition. In the past two years, my responsibilities included **reviewing papers** and **moderating sessions**.
